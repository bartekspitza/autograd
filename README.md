A Neural Network library written from scratch with no use of external libraries. Capable of forward **and backward** pass, capable of completing the mnist dataset task.

# Why?

Besides the obvious fact that it's cool and will make me feel good; Build the computation graph that is necessary for backprop, which is completely hidden when working with libraries in practice that makes the `backward()` call possible.
